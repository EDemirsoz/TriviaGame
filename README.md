# Trivia Game

This is a survey tool with gamified aspects that can be used for a trivia game or to help prepare students for tests. Users must provide a name to play the game. They will be presented with a set of questions, one at a time, with multiple-choice answers, and only one answer is correct. Users will be awarded points for correct answers based on how fast they answer. If the user fails to answer within the allotted time, zero points will be awarded. At the end of the game, a score will be provided along with a leaderboard.
